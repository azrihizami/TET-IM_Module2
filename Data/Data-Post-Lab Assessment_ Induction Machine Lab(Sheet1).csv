Motors run machines like pumps, fans, and conveyors. If we know how to check power, current, and power factor, we can make sure the motor runs well. For example, in a water plant, a motor that uses too much power will cost more money. Knowing about slip and torque helps pick the right motor size. If the motor is too small, it can overheat. This knowledge helps save energy and avoid damage in real industrial jobs."
